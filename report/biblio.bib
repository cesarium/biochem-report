	abstract = {Molecular simulations can elucidate atomistic-level mechanisms of key biological processes, which are often hardly accessible to experiment. However, the results of the simulations can only be as trustworthy as the underlying simulation model. In many of these processes, interactions between charged moieties play a critical role. Current empirical force fields tend to overestimate such interactions, often in a dramatic way, when polyvalent ions are involved. The source of this shortcoming is the missing electronic polarization in these models. Given the importance of such biomolecular systems, there is great interest in fixing this deficiency in a computationally inexpensive way without employing explicitly polarizable force fields. Here, we review the electronic continuum correction approach, which accounts for electronic polarization in a mean-field way, focusing on its charge scaling variant. We show that by pragmatically scaling only the charged molecular groups, we qualitatively improve the charge–charge interactions without extra computational costs and benefit from decades of force field development on biomolecular force fields.},

	abstract = {Hydrogen atoms cannot hide from x-rays anymore but can instead be detected very reliably in routine measurements., Precise and accurate structural information on hydrogen atoms is crucial to the study of energies of interactions important for crystal engineering, materials science, medicine, and pharmacy, and to the estimation of physical and chemical properties in solids. However, hydrogen atoms only scatter x-radiation weakly, so x-rays have not been used routinely to locate them accurately. Textbooks and teaching classes still emphasize that hydrogen atoms cannot be located with x-rays close to heavy elements; instead, neutron diffraction is needed. We show that, contrary to widespread expectation, hydrogen atoms can be located very accurately using x-ray diffraction, yielding bond lengths involving hydrogen atoms (A–H) that are in agreement with results from neutron diffraction mostly within a single standard deviation. The precision of the determination is also comparable between x-ray and neutron diffraction results. This has been achieved at resolutions as low as 0.8 Å using Hirshfeld atom refinement (HAR). We have applied HAR to 81 crystal structures of organic molecules and compared the A–H bond lengths with those from neutron measurements for A–H bonds sorted into bonds of the same class. We further show in a selection of inorganic compounds that hydrogen atoms can be located in bridging positions and close to heavy transition metals accurately and precisely. We anticipate that, in the future, conventional x-radiation sources at in-house diffractometers can be used routinely for locating hydrogen atoms in small molecules accurately instead of large-scale facilities such as spallation sources or nuclear reactors.},

	abstract = {We explore the enzymatic mechanism of the reduction of glutathione disulfide (GSSG) by the reduced a domain of human protein disulfide isomerase (hPDI) with atomistic resolution. We use classical molecular dynamics and hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics calculations at the mPW1N/6-311+G(2d,2p):FF99SB//mPW1N/6-31G(d):FF99SB level. The reaction proceeds in two stages: (i) a thiol-disulfide exchange through nucleophilic attack of the Cys53-thiolate to the GSSG-disulfide followed by the deprotonation of Cys56-thiol by Glu47-carboxylate and (ii) a second thiol-disulfide exchange between the Cys56-thiolate and the mixed disulfide intermediate formed in the first step. The Gibbs activation energy for the first stage was 18.7 kcal·mol-1, and for the second stage, it was 7.2 kcal·mol-1, in excellent agreement with the experimental barrier (17.6 kcal·mol-1). Our results also suggest that the catalysis by protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) and thiol-disulfide exchange is mostly enthalpy-driven (entropy changes below 2 kcal·mol-1 at all stages of the reaction). Hydrogen bonds formed between the backbone of His55 and Cys56 and the Cys56-thiol result in an increase in the Gibbs energy barrier of the first thiol-disulfide exchange. The solvent plays a key role in stabilizing the leaving glutathione thiolate formed. This role is not exclusively electrostatic, because an explicit inclusion of several water molecules at the density-functional theory level is a requisite to form the mixed disulfide intermediate. In the intramolecular oxidation of PDI, a transition state is only observed if hydrogen bond donors are nearby the mixed disulfide intermediate, which emphasizes that the thermochemistry of thiol-disulfide exchange in PDI is influenced by the presence of hydrogen bond donors.},

However, previous studies indicate that current force fields cannot, simultaneously, provide accurate descriptions of folded proteins and intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). Therefore, a CMAP optimized force field based on the Amber ff03 force field (termed ff03CMAP herein) was developed for balanced sampling of folded proteins and IDPs. Extensive validations of short peptides, folded proteins, disordered proteins, and fast-folding proteins show that simulated chemical shifts, J-coupling constants, order parameters, and residual dipolar couplings with the ff03CMAP force field are in very good agreement with NMR measurements and are more accurate than other ff03-series force fields. The influence of solvent models was also investigated. It was found that the combination of ff03CMAP/TIP4P-Ew is suitable for folded proteins and that of ff03CMAP/TIP4PD is better for disordered proteins. These findings confirm that the newly developed force field ff03CMAP can improve the balance of conformer sampling between folded proteins and IDPs.},

	abstract = {Molecular mechanics models have been applied extensively to study the dynamics of proteins and nucleic acids. Here we report the development of a third-generation point-charge all-atom force field for proteins. Following the earlier approach of Cornell et al., the charge set was obtained by fitting to the electrostatic potentials of dipeptides calculated using B3LYP/cc-pVTZ//HF/6-31G** quantum mechanical methods. The main-chain torsion parameters were obtained by fitting to the energy profiles of Ace-Ala-Nme and Ace-Gly-Nme di-peptides calculated using MP2/cc-pVTZ//HF/6-31G** quantum mechanical methods. All other parameters were taken from the existing AMBER data base. The major departure from previous force fields is that all quantum mechanical calculations were done in the condensed phase with continuum solvent models and an effective dielectric constant of epsilon = 4. We anticipate that this force field parameter set will address certain critical short comings of previous force fields in condensed-phase simulations of proteins. Initial tests on peptides demonstrated a high-degree of similarity between the calculated and the statistically measured Ramanchandran maps for both Ace-Gly-Nme and Ace-Ala-Nme di-peptides. Some highlights of our results include (1) well-preserved balance between the extended and helical region distributions, and (2) favorable type-II poly-proline helical region in agreement with recent experiments. Backward compatibility between the new and Cornell et al. charge sets, as judged by overall agreement between dipole moments, allows a smooth transition to the new force field in the area of ligand-binding calculations. Test simulations on a large set of proteins are also discussed.},

The QM/MM calculations are based on previous extensive classical MD simulations on the protein in complex with a model substrate (Piana, S.; Carloni, P.; Rothlisberger, U. Protein Sci. 2002, 11, 2393−2402). Gradient-corrected BLYP density functional theory (DFT) describes the reactive part of the active site, and the AMBER force field describes the rest of the protein, the solvent, and the counterions. An unbiased enhanced sampling of the QM/MM free-energy surface is performed to identify a plausible reaction coordinate for the second step of the reaction. The enzymatic reaction is characterized by two reaction free-energy barriers of ∼18 and ∼21 kcal mol-1 separated by a metastable gem−diol intermediate. In both steps, a proton transfer that involves the substrate and the two catalytic Asp molecules is observed. The orientation and the flexibility of the reactants, governed by the surrounding protein frame, are the key factors in determining the activation barrier. The calculated value for the barrier of the second step is slightly larger than the value expected from experimental data (∼16 kcal mol-1). An extensive comparison with calculations on gas-phase model systems at the Hartree−Fock, DFT-BP, DFT-BLYP, DFT-B3LYP, MP2, CCD, and QM/MM DFT-BLYP levels of theory suggests that the DFT-BLYP functional has the tendency to underestimate the energy of the gem−diol intermediate by ∼5−7 kcal mol-1.},

Force fields for DAPI have been parametrized to properly reflect its internal nonplanarity. Sequences investigated include the binding modes observed experimentally, that is, AATT in d(CGCGAATTCGCG)2 and ATTG in d(GGCCAATTGG)2 and alternative shifted binding modes ATTC and AATT, respectively. In each case, stable MD simulations are obtained, well reproducing specific hydration patterns seen in the experiments. In contrast to the 2.4 Å d(CGCGAATTCGCG)2 crystal structure, the DAPI is nonplanar, consistent with its gas-phase geometry and the higher resolution crystal structure. The simulations also suggest that the DAPI molecule is able to adopt different conformational substates accompanied by specific hydration patterns that include long-residing waters. The MM\_PBSA technology for estimating relative free energies was utilized. The most consistent free energy results were obtained with an approach that uses a single trajectory of the DNA−DAPI complex to estimate all free energy terms. It is demonstrated that explicit inclusion of a subset of bound water molecules shifts the calculated relative binding free energies in favor of both crystallographically observed binding modes, underlining the importance of structured hydration.},

Here, we outline the most recent developments, since version 9 was released in April 2006, of the Amber and AmberTools MD software packages, referred to here as simply the Amber package. The latest release represents six years of continued development, since version 9, by multiple research groups and the culmination of over 33 years of work beginning with the first version in 1979. The latest release of the Amber package, version 12 released in April 2012, includes a substantial number of important developments in both the scientific and computer science arenas. We present here a condensed vision of what Amber currently supports and where things are likely to head over the coming years.

	abstract = {The biochemical models describing complex and dynamic metabolic systems are typically multi-parametric and non-linear, thus the identification of their parameters requires non-linear regression analysis of the experimental data. The stochastic nature of the experimental samples poses the necessity to estimate not only the values fitting best to the model, but also the distribution of the parameters, and to test statistical hypotheses about the values of these parameters. In such situations the application of analytical models for parameter distributions is totally inappropriate because their assumptions are not applicable for intrinsically non-linear regressions. That is why, Monte Carlo simulations are a powerful tool to model biochemical processes. The classification of Monte Carlo approaches is not unified, so here we comply with the interpretation given in (Press et al., 1992), where the general Monte Carlo approach is to construct parallel virtual worlds, in which the experimental estimates will play the role of true parameters, if the way in which the true parameters generate a sample is known. Bootstrap is a modification of Monte Carlo, which uses very few premises imposed on the data, and does not need to know the mechanism by which the true parameters generate experimental samples. Instead, resampling with replacement from the experimental sample is used to construct synthetic samples. As far as confidence intervals (CI) are concerned, literature offers multiple types, but each of them belongs to one of the two main groups: root (Politis, 1998) and percentile intervals (Efron \& Tibshirani, 1993). The difference in the philosophy of those two CI types is substantial for the biochemical interpretation of results. The difference here is explained with the difference between classical statistics (where the parameters are fixed unknown quantities) and Bayesian statistics (where the parameters are random variables with unknown distributions), and also with the philosophical differences between objectivity and subjectivity of scientific research. The main conclusion is that root confidence intervals are confidence intervals of the investigated parameters, whereas percentile confidence intervals refer to the estimates of the investigated parameters. Our first application of Monte Carlo and Bootstrap simulation procedures is with a simulation platform for training students in medical biochemistry (Tenekedjiev \& Kolev, 2002). In this system, students search for estimates and confidence intervals of parameters of a given biochemical system for different enzyme-substrate pairs. The platform applies Monte Carlo simulation on two stages. Initially, a Monte Carlo procedure is applied to emulate a biochemical experimental measurement setting along with given enzyme kinetic reactions as realistically as possible. The system is in position to simulate continuous enzyme assay (used for adjustment of the “experimental” conditions) and end-point enzyme assay “measurements” (suitable for parameter identification). We use an ordinary differential equation (ODE) as basis of the generation of pseudo-experimental data. The pseudo-real nature of the generated data is ensured by the random incorporation of three types of errors for each repetition of the experiments. The Briggs-Haldane steady-state model is fitted to the pseudo-measured and end-point assay data obtained by the system. The kinetic parameters can be calculated by χ2-minimization. The task is simplified by the existence of a good initial guess from a linearized Lineweaver-Burk model. The two-dimensional root confidence regions of the parameters can be calculated by either Monte Carlo or Bootstrap, following similar procedures. The best point estimate is identified using trimmed mean over the flipped parameters taking only the values from the identified root confidence region. In the majority of biochemical reactions, parameters are unknown in very wide intervals, and may have different numerical order. Finding the root confidence regions (intervals) includes parameter flipping, which often generates results with an incorrect sign. That is why, in a second example (Tanka-Salamon et al., 2008) we propose a multiplicative modification for the estimation of root confidence regions and the best estimate of the parameters, which ensures that all estimates will have a physical meaning. The main assumption is that the ratio between the true parameter value and the optimal parameter value derived from the true data sample has the same distribution as the ratio between the optimal parameter value derived from the true data sample, and the optimal synthetic parameter value derived from the synthetic data sample. The assumption is equivalent to performing classical Bootstrap over the logarithms of the estimated parameters. This method is applied in a real experimental set-up for the estimation of root confidence regions of kinetic constants and root best estimates in amidolytic activity of plasmin under the influence of three fatty acids. By doing so, the inhibition effect of the three fatty acids can be proven and quantified. The measured data have the form of continuous reaction progress curves with several replicas. The product concentrations are predicted by three different models with increasing complexity. We model the instability of the inhibited enzyme and represent the resulting continuous assay model with concomitant inactivation of the enzyme as a system of two stiff ODE. From there, we derive the closed form of the progress curve. The four-dimensional root confidence regions are acquired by Monte Carlo simulation in every data point in each of the progress curves using an analytical model of the measured standard deviation, similarly to the first example.},

After a brief survey of current models, mostly generated during the 1990s, the focus of the chapter is on the general directions the field is taking in developing new models. The most commonly used protein force fields incorporate a relatively simple potential energy function: The emphasis is on the use of continuum methods to model the electrostatic effects of hydration and the introduction of polarizability to model the electronic response to changes in the environment. Some of the history and performance of widely used protein force fields based on an equation on simplest potential energy function or closely related equations are reviewed. The chapter outlines some promising developments that go beyond this, primarily by altering the way electrostatic interactions are treated. The use of atomic multipoles and off-center charge distributions, as well as attempts to incorporate electronic polarizability, are also discussed in the chapter.},
